What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When a repository is initialized with "git init", Git creates a hidden file called .git
that contains all of the metadata about that particular Git repository. You need to initialize
a repository so that your version history can be tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the place where files go to be packaged into a particular commit. 
The working directory is the directory where all of your files are.
And the repository is your collection of files in the working directory plus the hidden .git file.
The value that the staging area offers is that it allows one to select which files to package
into a commit without selecting every file in the directory.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By selecting which files you want to commit, you can select only the files containing a particular change
for a commit, and leave other files containing a different logical change for another commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches would be helpful in a situation where you want to add or delete a particular feature
but still keep the original features intact. Branches allow you to create multiple versions
of your project that you can still easily access and modify.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They allow one to see the commits for each branch that are shown when you run "git log" on a particular branch.
