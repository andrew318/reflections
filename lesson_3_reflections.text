When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Whenever one would want to share a project with others and/or allow other people to contribute
to a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because other people could have added things to the remote repository that you don't want in your local version.
You might instead want to push your changes to the remote and fix any merge conflicts. That way, your version
of the project is on GitHub, not someone else's.
